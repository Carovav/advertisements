    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.â€”We would call the attention of persons
        interested in Egyptian trade to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce
        of Egypt, whose office in Alexandria gives information as to standings
        trade, &amp;c., to its members, and whose monthly publication reviews our
        commerce. The annual subscription is 11 and all British traders should
        become members. Our London office, 36, New Broad- street E.C., acts as
